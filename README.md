# Predicting daily S&P 500 closing prices using Linear Regression

The goal of this project was to accurately predict the price of the S&P 500 Index based off of historical performance. 
The data I initially used included the daily opening price and closing price of the S&P 500 from 1950 to 2015. 
I trained the model using data from 1950-2012 in order to make predictions from 2013-2015. 
After making a set of initial predictions based off of the closing price from prior days, I ran additional sets of 
predictions which took into account day of the week and unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

## Accessing the analysis
